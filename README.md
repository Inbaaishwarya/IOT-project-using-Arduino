# Project Summary
The concept behind the Automatic Water Dispenser is 
very simple. We will use Moisture level sensor to check if 
the plant contain minimum or limited level of water 
before the dispenser is placed. Arduino in it used to 
control the flow of water, which is energized the water 
will flow out and when we de-energized the water will be 
stopped. So, we will write the Arduino program that 
initiates the process of dispenser, check the moisture 
sensor if the plant contains water, then there will be no 
flow of water if not if supplies water through Arduino 
using motor pump. As the result, plants can survive more 
longer than it is leading normally.
